# Detection of Brain Tumors Using Two Methods: CNN and Transfer Learning
## Description
> Our project focuses on using artificial intelligence, specifically **transfer learning** with **Keras** and **TensorFlow**, for the automatic detection of brain tumors from MRI images. We are developing a specialized algorithm to accurately analyze these images, employing advanced image processing techniques to enhance diagnostic quality. The goal is to evaluate our system's performance against traditional methods and to create a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals, facilitating its adoption in clinical settings.
